# SMB CTF Challenge: Medium Difficulty

## Objective

Your goal is to exploit a vulnerability in an SMB service to retrieve a file that contains the flag. This challenge requires understanding of SMB protocols, exploit techniques, and network configurations.

## Scenario

You have accessed a network where an SMB service is running. This service has a vulnerability that allows unauthorized access under certain conditions. Your task is to identify the vulnerability, exploit it, and retrieve the flag from the `secret_flag.txt` file located at the root of the SMB share.

## Rules

- Do not attack other services on the network.
- The use of automated tools and scripts is allowed.
- Teams and collaboration are permitted.
- Stay ethical and professional.

## Hints

1. Consider exploring common SMB vulnerabilities and exploits.
2. Remember to enumerate all shares and access levels.
3. Use tools like `smbclient`, `nmap`, and `metasploit` to facilitate your investigation.

Good luck, and may the best hacker win!
