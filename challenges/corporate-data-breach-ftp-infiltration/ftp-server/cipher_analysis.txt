CIPHER ANALYSIS REPORT
======================

Target: encrypted_client_data.txt
Analysis Date: 2024-01-15

Observations:
1. Text appears to be arranged in multiple rows
2. Pattern suggests geometric transposition cipher
3. Characters seem to follow a zigzag reading pattern
4. Additional encoding layer detected (Base64)

Frequency Analysis:
Most common characters: _, e, r, c, n, f, t
Pattern length: Varies by row

Recommended Approach:
- Analyze rail fence cipher with different key lengths
- Try keys 2-5 for optimal results
- Decode any additional encoding layers
- Verify result with provided checksum

Security Notes:
- Cipher appears to use default configuration
- No salt or additional obfuscation detected
- Vulnerable to systematic attack

Tools Suggested:
- Custom rail fence decoder
- Base64 decoder
- MD5 hash verification
