# Multi-Vulnerability Exploitation Challenge

## Learning Objectives
- Understand XSS vulnerabilities and their impacts
- Identify and exploit misconfigured FTP services
- Recognize weak SSH configurations
- Exploit backdoor vulnerabilities in VSFTPD

## Description
This challenge consists of multiple services, each with its own vulnerability:

1. **Web (XSS Vulnerability)**: A simple Flask application vulnerable to Stored XSS.
2. **FTP (Misconfiguration)**: A misconfigured FTP server allowing unauthorized access.
3. **SSH (Weak Config)**: An SSH server with a weak root password.
4. **VSFTPD (Backdoor Exploit)**: A VSFTPD server with a known backdoor vulnerability.

Each service runs in its own container, providing an isolated environment to exploit these vulnerabilities.

### Access
- **Web**: `http://web:8080`
- **FTP**: Connect to 172.20.0.20:21
- **SSH**: Connect to 172.20.0.30:22
- **VSFTPD**: Connect to 172.20.0.40:21

### Notes
- Use the Kali container as an attacker workspace for exploitation.
- Search for the respective flags in each service!
