# SSH Misconfiguration Exploration

## Challenge Overview
This challenge requires participants to use Nmap to identify open ports and recognize SSH misconfigurations on the server machine. By exploiting the misconfiguration, they can gain unauthorized access to the system.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use Nmap for port scanning
- Identify and exploit SSH misconfigurations
- Gain access to a system through weak SSH configurations

## Instructions
1. Use Nmap from the Kali Attacker machine to scan the server.
2. Identify the SSH service running on the server.
3. Exploit the SSH misconfiguration to access the server and retrieve the flag.

## Access
- SSH Server: 172.25.0.10:22
- Attacker can access resources through http://172.25.0.100

## Flag Location
The flag is located in `/root/flag.txt` on the server.
