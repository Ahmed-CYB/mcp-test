Congratulations! You have successfully:
1. Discovered the non-standard HTTP service on port 28
2. Identified the directory traversal vulnerability in /files/
3. Exploited the path traversal to access restricted directories
4. Located sensitive configuration and administrative files

This challenge demonstrated:
- Network service discovery techniques
- Web application vulnerability assessment
- Directory traversal exploitation
- Information gathering from exposed files

In a real environment, this type of misconfiguration could lead to:
- Exposure of sensitive configuration data
- Credential disclosure
- Unauthorized access to administrative functions
- Further network compromise

Recommended fixes:
- Implement proper path sanitization
- Remove directory traversal vulnerabilities
- Change default credentials
- Restrict access to administrative directories
- Use standard ports or implement proper security controls
