# Library Portal SQL Injection Challenge

## Learning Objectives
- Understand SQL Injection vulnerabilities
- Practice exploiting SQL Injection to extract hidden data
- Learn how to use union-based SQL Injection

## Scenario
A university's library portal is suspected to have security issues. Your task is to find and exploit these vulnerabilities to capture the flag hidden in the system.

## Challenge
Access the library portal at http://victim:8080 and identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

## Deployment
- Use `docker-compose up` to start the challenge.
- Access the Kali Linux attacker environment at http://localhost:6901 (password: password).

## Flag
The flag is stored in a hidden database entry.
