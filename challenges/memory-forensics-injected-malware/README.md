# Memory Forensics: Malware Injection

## Challenge Description
A security firm has reported potential malware activity on a corporate server. As part of the incident response team, your task is to analyze the memory dump from the server.

## Objective
Use Volatility3 to analyze the provided memory dump. Identify the malicious process and extract the flag hidden in its memory space.

## Steps
1. **Identify Suspicious Processes**: Use the `linux.pslist` plugin to list running processes and identify any anomalies.
2. **Analyze Process Memory**: Employ the `linux.proc.maps` and `linux.dump` plugins to examine the memory of the suspicious process.
3. **Decode the Flag**: The flag is base64 encoded within the process's memory. Use Volatility to extract and decode it.

## Tools Required
- Volatility3

## Expected Difficulty
Hard

## Hints
- Start with identifying all running processes.
- Look for any process with unusual memory mappings.
- The flag is hidden using base64 encoding within the memory space.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use Volatility for memory analysis.
- Learn to identify and analyze malicious processes.
- Gain experience in decoding obfuscated data from memory dumps.
