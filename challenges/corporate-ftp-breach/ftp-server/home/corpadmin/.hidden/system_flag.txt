CTF{ftp_anonymous_directory_traversal_pwned}

Congratulations! You successfully exploited the FTP misconfigurations:

1. Anonymous FTP access enabled
2. No chroot jail configured
3. Directory traversal allowed
4. Read access to sensitive system files
5. Weak file permissions

This flag represents a complete compromise of the corporate FTP server
through enumeration, anonymous access, and directory traversal.

=== Attack Vector Summary ===
- Port scan discovered FTP service on port 21
- Anonymous login successful (no password required)
- Directory traversal to access /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow
- Enumeration of user directories
- Discovery of sensitive corporate documents
- Flag retrieval from hidden directory

Real-world impact: Complete system compromise, data exfiltration,
credential harvesting, and corporate espionage potential.
