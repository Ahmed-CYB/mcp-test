# SMB Vulnerability CTF Challenge

## Introduction
Welcome to the SMB Vulnerability Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenge! In this challenge, you will step into the shoes of a cyber archaeologist, tasked with unearthing ancient digital secrets locked away within a vulnerable SMB protocol.

## Story
In a digital landscape echoing with secrets, the forgotten Atticus Corporation archive has resurfaced. Within its old SMB shares lay untold mysteries and perhaps the keys to vast virtual treasures. As a skilled investigator, your mission is to navigate this byte labyrinth and decrypt the past.

## Objectives

2. **Explore and Uncover**: Traverse through the various shares named `Ancient_Logs`, `Forgotten_Ciphers`, and `Engineers_Notes`. These hold crucial logs, ciphers, and notes that will guide you to the hidden flag.
3. **Capture the Flag**: Using your skills and the clues found during exploration, find and capture the hidden flag.
