FTP Server Infiltration Hints:

1. Network Discovery:
   - Standard FTP runs on port 21
   - Look for backup files and configuration data
   - Check common directories: /etc/, /var/log/, /home/

2. Authentication:
   - Try common credentials: admin/admin, admin/password, admin/backup123
   - Look for credential files in backup locations
   - FTP servers often store config in predictable locations

3. Cryptographic Analysis:
   - The encrypted flag uses a classical cipher method
   - Rail fence ciphers arrange text in a zigzag pattern
   - Count the number of rails mentioned in configuration files
   - Read the pattern: top rail, second rail, third rail, bottom rail

4. Decryption Process:
   - Identify the cipher type from configuration hints
   - Determine the key (number of rails) from backup files
   - Arrange the ciphertext in the proper rail pattern
   - Read off the plaintext in the correct order

Remember: Corporate security often relies on 'security through obscurity' - but configuration files tell the real story!
