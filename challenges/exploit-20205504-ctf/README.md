# CVE-2020-5504 Exploitation Challenge

## Overview
Welcome to the CVE-2020-5504 exploitation challenge. In this scenario, you are a penetration tester tasked with assessing a company's web application that is known to have a vulnerability due to improper handling of parameters.

## Objective
Your goal is to exploit the vulnerability to gain remote code execution on the server and retrieve the flag stored in the `flag.txt` file located in the `/var/www/` directory.

## Environment
The provided Docker container simulates a vulnerable application environment. Use `docker-compose up` to start the environment.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the challenge directory.
2. Build and run the Docker container using `docker-compose up`.
3. Investigate the available web interface for potential exploits.
4. Craft an exploit to achieve remote code execution.
5. Capture the flag from the server.

## Hints
- Think about how parameters are handled in PHP scripts.
- Look for file inclusion or code injection vectors.

Good luck, and happy hacking!
