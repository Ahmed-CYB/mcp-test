# CVE-2020-5504 Challenge - Advanced Scenario

Welcome to the advanced exploitation challenge for CVE-2020-5504. This challenge will require you to leverage multiple vulnerabilities to ultimately retrieve the flag.

### Scenario Overview
Your mission is to exploit a vulnerable web application running a specific version of PHP. However, simple exploitation won't suffice this time. You'll need to chain together several vulnerabilities and security misconfigurations.

### Objectives
1. **Initial Access**: Begin by locating an initial foothold using a known CVE related to the web application's components.
2. **Privilege Escalation**: Utilize weak permissions and outdated software to escalate your privileges within the system.
3. **Data Exfiltration**: Once you have sufficient privileges, identify and exfiltrate sensitive data that may lead you to the flag.
4. **Flag Retrieval**: Use the gathered intelligence to finally track down and retrieve the flag.

### Detailed Steps
- Analyze the web application's source code to identify misconfigurations.
- Search for additional vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.
- Monitor network traffic to uncover hidden endpoints or undocumented features.

### Tools and Hints
- **Tools**: Consider using tools like `Burp Suite`, `nmap`, `Wireshark`, and `Metasploit` to assist with exploitation.
- **Hints**:
  - Think like an attacker and search for logical flaws.
  - Some endpoints are hidden and may require creative techniques to access.

**Good luck, and may your skills lead you to victory!**
