# Multi-Machine CTF Challenge

## Challenge Overview
This CTF challenge involves exploiting multiple vulnerabilities across different services. The challenge is designed to test skills in XSS, FTP misconfigurations, SSH brute-force attacks, and the VSFTPD backdoor vulnerability.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and exploit stored XSS vulnerabilities
- Identify and exploit FTP misconfigurations
- Perform SSH brute-force attacks
- Exploit the VSFTPD backdoor vulnerability

## Services and IP Addresses
- Web Server (XSS): http://172.25.0.10:8080
- FTP Server: ftp://172.25.0.20
- SSH Server: ssh://172.25.0.30
- VSFTP Server: ftp://172.25.0.40

## Access Credentials
- FTP User: ftpuser
- FTP Password: passw0rd
- SSH User: root
- SSH Password: toor

## Flag Location
- XSS: Embedded in the web application
- FTP: Located in the `/var/www/html/flag.txt`
- SSH: Flag can be obtained after successful login
- VSFTP: Exploit the backdoor to discover the flag
