# ftp-anonymous-exploitation

## Description
A corporate file server running FTP has been misconfigured to allow anonymous access. The server contains sensitive files that should not be publicly accessible. Your task is to exploit the FTP service to gain unauthorized access and retrieve confidential information.

## Scenario
TechCorp's file server administrator recently set up an FTP service for file sharing between departments. Due to a misconfiguration, the FTP server allows anonymous login and provides access to directories containing sensitive corporate data. As a penetration tester, you need to identify this vulnerability and extract the confidential flag file.

## Difficulty
medium

## Machines
- **ftp-server** (victim): 172.25.145.198 - ftp, ssh

## Hints

2. FTP servers sometimes allow anonymous login - try connecting without credentials
3. Once connected, explore the directory structure to find sensitive files
4. Corporate directories often contain the most valuable information

## Flag Format
CTF{ftp_anonymous_access_is_dangerous}
