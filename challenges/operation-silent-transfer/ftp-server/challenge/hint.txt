HINTS FOR OPERATION SILENT TRANSFER:

1. The intelligence file appears to be encoded using a common encoding scheme first
2. After decoding, you'll find a classical cipher that shifts letters by a fixed amount
3. The cipher type is mentioned in the decoded text - look for clues about the shift value
4. ROT13 is a special case of a more general cipher family
5. The flag format follows standard CTF conventions: CTF{...}

TOOLS YOU MIGHT NEED:
- Base64 decoder
- ROT cipher tools or manual shifting
- Text analysis utilities

REMEMBER: Sometimes the simplest ciphers hide in plain sight!
