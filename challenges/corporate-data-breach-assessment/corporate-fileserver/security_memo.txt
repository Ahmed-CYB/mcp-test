RE: Legacy Encryption Standards

Team,

Due to compatibility requirements with our legacy systems, we continue to use our traditional cipher method for project data encryption. Please note:

1. All sensitive data is first converted to binary representation
2. The binary data then undergoes character substitution using ROT13
3. This dual-layer approach ensures backward compatibility

Reminder: The substitution cipher shifts each letter by exactly 13 positions in the alphabet. Numbers and special characters remain unchanged.

For decryption procedures, reverse the process:
- Apply ROT13 to decode the substituted characters
- Convert the resulting binary back to ASCII text

Please ensure all staff with Level 3 clearance are familiar with this process.

Regards,
CIO Office
