SECURITY ASSESSMENT NOTES:

1. The FTP server stores client reports in an unusual format
2. Files appear to be double-encoded for 'extra security'
3. Configuration files may contain encryption keys
4. Look for patterns in the administrator's naming conventions
5. Binary data should be converted to text before decryption
6. Classic ciphers often use simple keys that relate to the context

REMEMBER: The goal is to extract the hidden flag from the client report to demonstrate the vulnerability.
