# Weak SSH Password Challenge

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the risks of weak password policies.
- Learn to use brute force techniques to exploit weak SSH credentials.
- Gain practical experience with SSH access.

## Scenario
The company has set up a new server for internal use, but due to rushed deadlines, proper security measures were overlooked. Your task is to gain access to the server by exploiting weak password practices and retrieve the flag located in the /root/flag.txt file.

## Accessing the Challenge
- Use the Kali Linux desktop provided via VNC (password: `password`) to attack the target.
- The target SSH server is accessible at hostname `victim` and private IP `172.22.0.10`.

## Tools
- Use tools like Hydra or John the Ripper to perform password brute-forcing.
