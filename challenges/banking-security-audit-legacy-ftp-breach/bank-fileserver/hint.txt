SECURITY AUDIT FINDINGS:

1. The audit log contains MD5 hashes - these are cryptographically weak
2. MD5 is vulnerable to collision attacks and rainbow tables
3. The base64 encoded temp key might be related to the encryption
4. Look for common passwords that could produce those hash values
5. The encrypted file appears to use OpenSSL's Salted format
6. Try cracking the MD5 hashes first - they might be simple passwords
7. Tools to consider: hashcat, john the ripper, online MD5 crackers
8. Once you find the password, use it to decrypt the customer records
