# Weak SSH Key Vulnerability

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the risks of using weak or exposed SSH keys.
- Learn how to exploit SSH key vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

## Scenario
A small company has configured its server to allow SSH access using a weak private key. As a security researcher, your task is to exploit this configuration error to gain unauthorized access and capture the flag located on the server.

## Instructions
- Access the Kali Linux GUI at http://attacker:6901 with the password 'password'.
- Use tools available on Kali to identify and exploit the weak SSH key.
- Once access is gained, navigate to the home directory of the user to find the flag.
