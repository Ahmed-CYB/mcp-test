# FTP and SSH Misconfiguration Challenge

## Scenario
A small tech company has set up an FTP server for file sharing and an SSH service for remote access. Due to improper security practices, both services are vulnerable.

## Objectives
- Exploit FTP server misconfigurations.
- Gain unauthorized SSH access.
- Retrieve the flag located in the FTP directory.

## Access
- Use Kali Linux to attack the victim machine at IP 172.25.0.10.
- FTP is accessible anonymously. Check configurations for potential exploits.
- SSH is configured with weak security. Use default credentials to access.
