# Network Service Exploitation

## Scenario Description

A target server is running a vulnerable network service. Participants must discover the service, identify the vulnerability, and exploit it to gain access to the victim machine and retrieve the flag.

## Challenge Information

- **Categories:** network
- **Machines:** 2
- **Stages:** 4

## Network Architecture

| Machine | Type | IP Address | Services |
|---------|------|------------|----------|
| attacker-machine | attacker | 172.26.193.3 | ssh |
| victim-server | victim | 172.26.193.115 | vulnerable-service, ssh |

## Challenge Stages

### Stage 1

Network reconnaissance to discover open ports and services

### Stage 2

Service enumeration and vulnerability identification

### Stage 3

Exploit the vulnerable service to gain access

### Stage 4

Retrieve the flag from the compromised system

## Getting Started

1. Access the attacker machine via Guacamole
2. Scan the network to identify target machines
3. Follow the scenario stages to progress
4. Capture the flag!

## Learning Objectives

- Network scanning and service exploitation
