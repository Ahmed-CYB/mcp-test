# samba-guest-exploitation

## Description
A corporate file server running Samba has been misconfigured to allow guest access. Your mission is to exploit this misconfiguration to gain unauthorized access to sensitive files and retrieve the hidden flag.

## Scenario
TechCorp's IT department recently deployed a new file server running Samba to share documents across the organization. However, the system administrator made a critical error in the configuration, enabling guest access without proper restrictions. As a penetration tester, you've been hired to assess the security of this server and demonstrate the potential risks of such misconfigurations.

## Difficulty
medium

## Machines
- **samba-server** (victim): 172.28.145.81 - samba, ssh
- **attacker** (attacker): 172.28.145.3 - ssh

## Hints
1. Start by scanning the target to identify open ports and services
2. SMB services often allow guest or anonymous access - try connecting without credentials
3. Use smbclient with null authentication to list and access shares
4. Look for shares that allow guest access and browse their contents

## Flag Format
CTF{samba_guest_access_pwned}
