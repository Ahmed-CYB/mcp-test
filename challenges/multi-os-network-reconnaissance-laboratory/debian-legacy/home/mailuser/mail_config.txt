LEGACY MAIL SERVER CONFIGURATION
=================================

SMTP Configuration:
Server: debian-legacy.lab.local
Port: 25 (Standard SMTP)
Security: None (Legacy compatibility mode)

Administrative Access:
Protocol: Telnet (for legacy systems)
Port: 25 (shared with SMTP for stealth)
Username: mailuser
Password: mail2019

IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE:
=========================
The telnet service is intentionally running on port 25
to blend with SMTP traffic and avoid detection.
This configuration allows remote administration
of the mail server through the same port.

To access admin interface:
1. Connect to port 25 via telnet
2. Ignore SMTP banner messages
3. Login with mailuser credentials
4. Navigate to /home/mailuser for configuration files

FLAG LOCATION: /home/mailuser/admin/secret_key.txt

This flag represents successful reconnaissance and
service enumeration of our stealth configuration.
