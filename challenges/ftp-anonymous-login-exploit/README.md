# FTP Anonymous Login Exploit

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the risks of enabling anonymous FTP access
- Learn how to identify and exploit FTP misconfigurations
- Practice using FTP clients to explore server contents

## Challenge Background
The local book club has set up an FTP server to share reading materials among its members. However, they've misconfigured the server, allowing anonymous users to log in and access sensitive files. Your mission is to exploit this vulnerability and retrieve the hidden flag from the FTP server.

## Accessing the Challenge
1. Use any FTP client from the provided Kali Linux environment to connect to the FTP server at `ftp://172.25.0.10`.
2. Log in using the username `anonymous` with any password.
3. Navigate through the directories to find and read the flag file.

## Hints
- Start by connecting to the FTP server using an FTP client like `ftp` or `FileZilla`.
- Use the `anonymous` login to access the server.
- Look for files in the public directory.

## Flag
The flag is located within the FTP server's public directory in a file named `flag.txt`.
