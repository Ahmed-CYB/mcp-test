Corporate Cipher Analysis Guide
==============================

Our security team has identified a multi-layered encryption scheme
used by the corporate backup system. Analysis suggests:

1. The encrypted data appears to be hexadecimal encoded
2. After hex decoding, the result seems to be Base64 encoded
3. The final layer may use a simple character substitution

Tools that may be useful:
- xxd (for hex operations)
- base64 (for Base64 decoding)
- tr (for character translation)
- python3 (for scripting)

Example workflow:
- Convert hex to binary data
- Decode the Base64 layer
- Apply character transformation

The flag format follows standard CTF conventions: CTF{...}

Remember: Corporate data must be handled with appropriate care
even in training scenarios.
