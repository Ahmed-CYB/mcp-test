Investigation Hints for Security Audit:
=======================================

1. FTP Authentication Analysis:
   - Check the login logs for failed/successful attempts
   - MD5 hashes can be cracked using rainbow tables or brute force
   - Look for common passwords in corporate environments

2. Data Recovery Process:
   - The encrypted database uses multiple encoding layers
   - Start with the outermost encoding and work inward
   - Common encoding types: Hex, Base64, ROT13

3. Tools Recommended:
   - hashcat or john for hash cracking
   - CyberChef for multi-layer decoding
   - Online MD5 databases for quick lookups

4. Attack Vector:
   - Compromise FTP credentials first
   - Use credentials to decrypt the stolen database
   - Corporate flag format: CTF{...}

Remember: This is a controlled security assessment.
Document all findings for the final report.
