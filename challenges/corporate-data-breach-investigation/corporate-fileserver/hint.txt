SMB Brute Force & Crypto Challenge Hints:

1. SMB ACCESS:
   - Enumerate SMB shares first using smbclient or smbmap
   - Look for credentials or password patterns in public shares
   - Try common corporate password patterns
   - Company name + founding year is a common pattern

2. DECRYPTION PROCESS:
   - The encrypted document contains base64 encoded data
   - First decode the base64 to get raw binary data
   - Then XOR decrypt using the key found in SMB shares
   - The XOR key repeats across the entire message

3. TOOLS NEEDED:
   - smbclient (SMB access)
   - hydra (brute force if needed)
   - base64 decoder
   - XOR decryption tool (CyberChef, Python, etc.)

4. ATTACK CHAIN:
   SMB Enum → Credential Discovery → Share Access → Key Retrieval → Decrypt Flag

Remember: Look for patterns in corporate environments!
