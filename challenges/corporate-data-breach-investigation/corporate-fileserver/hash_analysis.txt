Hash Collision Analysis Report
============================

Weak Hash Detected: 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592 (MD5)
Plaintext discovered: hello

Hash Properties:
- Algorithm: MD5
- Bit length: 128
- Known vulnerabilities: Collision attacks, rainbow tables
- Recommended replacement: SHA-256 or bcrypt

Collision Analysis:
- This hash has known collisions
- Attacker exploited weak authentication
- Original password appears to be a common string

Additional Intelligence:
- Backup encryption uses simple XOR cipher
- Key derivation based on mathematical constant
- Binary encoding adds obfuscation layer

Recommendations:
1. Implement stronger hashing algorithms
2. Use salt for password storage
3. Replace XOR encryption with AES
4. Regular security audits of SMB configurations
