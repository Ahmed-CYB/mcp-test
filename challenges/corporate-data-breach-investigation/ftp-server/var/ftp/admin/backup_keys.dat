Backup Encryption Keys - Internal Use Only

Project: BIO-3986 Research Data Protection
Encryption Method: Base64 + ROT13 Nested Encryption

Key Information:
- First layer: Base64 encoding applied to plaintext
- Second layer: ROT13 cipher applied to Base64 output
- Decryption: Reverse ROT13 first, then decode Base64

Example decryption process:
1. Apply ROT13 to encrypted text
2. Decode resulting Base64 string
3. Original plaintext revealed

This nested approach was implemented to obfuscate sensitive research data.
Decryption tools: Any ROT13 decoder + Base64 decoder
