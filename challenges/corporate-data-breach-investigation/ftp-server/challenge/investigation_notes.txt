CORPORATE BREACH INVESTIGATION NOTES
=====================================

1. FTP server appears to be compromised
2. Sensitive database files have been encrypted
3. Attackers may have left encryption keys on the server
4. Database contains critical security information
5. Multiple user accounts show suspicious activity

HINTS:
- Check system backup files for encryption keys
- The database uses XOR encryption with a text key
- Network logs show which files were accessed
- Look for files in /confidential and /system directories
- The flag is hidden in the encrypted database content
