# Exploit Challenge: CVE-2020-5504

## Overview

Welcome to the exciting world of security and exploitation! In this challenge, you are tasked with exploiting a known vulnerability, CVE-2020-5504, found in a specific web application setup.

## Challenge Details

This vulnerability is associated with an Apache server running PHP scripts without sufficient input validation. Your goal is to exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Environment Setup

The vulnerable application is containerized using Docker. Use the provided Dockerfile to set up and run the environment. The application will be available on `localhost:80`.

## Your Task

1. **Identify the Vulnerability:** Begin by analyzing the web application hosted in the Docker environment. Identify the weak spots and possible entry points based on CVE-2020-5504.

2. **Exploit the Vulnerability:** Develop an exploit to execute arbitrary commands on the server. Retrieve the flag stored in the `/flag.txt` file located on the server.

3. **Capture the Flag:** Achieve the goal by sending the exploit, gaining access, and capturing the flag.

## Hints

- Review how input is handled by the PHP scripts. Look for areas where input validation is missing.
- Test inputs with various payloads to bypass any sanitation mechanisms.
- Debugging tools like `Burp Suite` can help in analyzing the HTTP requests.

## Good Luck!

Explore the vulnerable setup, craft your exploit, and capture the flag to become the master of this challenge!
