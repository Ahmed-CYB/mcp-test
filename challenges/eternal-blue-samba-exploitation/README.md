# eternal-blue-samba-exploitation

## Description
A corporate file server running an outdated Samba service is vulnerable to the infamous EternalBlue exploit (CVE-2017-0144). The server contains sensitive corporate documents that need to be accessed. Your mission is to exploit the SMB vulnerability to gain unauthorized access and retrieve the classified flag.

## Scenario
TechCorp's legacy file server has been running the same Samba configuration for years without updates. Recent intelligence suggests that this server contains critical information about their upcoming product launch. As a penetration tester, you've been tasked to assess the security of their file sharing infrastructure. The server is known to be vulnerable to MS17-010 (EternalBlue) due to outdated SMB protocol implementation.

## Difficulty
medium

## Machines
- **samba-server** (victim): 172.26.193.16 - smb, netbios
- **attacker** (attacker): 172.26.193.3 - 

## Hints
1. Start by scanning the target for open SMB ports and services
2. Check if the SMB service is vulnerable to MS17-010 using Metasploit auxiliary modules
3. The EternalBlue exploit targets SMB protocol vulnerabilities - look for disabled signing and legacy protocols
4. Use Metasploit's ms17_010_eternalblue exploit module against the vulnerable Samba service
