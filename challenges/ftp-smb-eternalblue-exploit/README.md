# FTP and SMB EternalBlue Exploit Challenge

## Scenario
In this challenge, your objective is to compromise two different services running on separate machines.

- **FTP Server**: The FTP server is configured to allow anonymous logins. There may be a flag hidden within the file structure.

- **SMB Server**: The SMB server is vulnerable to the EternalBlue exploit (MS17-010). Exploiting this vulnerability can give you access to sensitive files.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand FTP service security pitfalls, particularly anonymous login configurations.
- Learn how to exploit the SMBv1 protocol using the EternalBlue vulnerability.
- Practice multi-target exploitation in a networked environment.

## Instructions
1. Use the provided Kali Linux container to discover and exploit the vulnerabilities in the FTP and SMB services.
2. The flag is located on both services, demonstrating how a multi-pronged attack can be conducted.

## Access
- FTP Server: `ftp://172.25.0.10`
- SMB Server: `\172.25.0.20\Share`
- Kali Attacker Environment: Access through provided VNC interface with default credentials.
