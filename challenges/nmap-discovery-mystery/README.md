# Nmap Discovery Mystery

## Learning Objectives
- Learn to use nmap for network discovery
- Identify open ports and services on a network
- Understand the basics of network scanning and enumeration

## Challenge Description
Your task is to perform a network scan using nmap to identify open services on the victim server. Analyze the results to find any potential misconfigurations or vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

## Deployment
- Launch the challenge using Docker Compose
- Access the Kali Linux GUI to perform your scans

## Access Instructions
- The victim server is located at 10.10.10.10
- Use your skills with nmap to list open ports and services

## Flag
Retrieve the flag by identifying the open services and understanding the potential vulnerabilities.

## Hints
1. Start with a basic nmap scan to see what services are visible.
2. Look for uncommon open ports that might provide more insight.
3. Investigate any misconfigured services that could expose sensitive information.

Good luck!
