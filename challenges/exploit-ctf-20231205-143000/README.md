# Latest Exploit Challenge

## Challenge Overview

Welcome to the latest exploit challenge! In this challenge, you will be tasked with exploiting a vulnerable web application running on an Apache server.

### Objective
Your goal is to gain unauthorized access to the server and retrieve the hidden flag located in the `/var/www/flag.txt` file.

### Instructions
1. Deploy the Docker container using the provided Dockerfile.
2. Once deployed, the vulnerable application will be accessible on port 80.
3. Investigate and identify the vulnerability in the web application.
4. Use appropriate tools and techniques to exploit the vulnerability and access the flag.

### Hints

- Consider common web vulnerabilities such as Remote Code Execution or SQL Injection.
- Use tools like `curl` and `Burp Suite` to analyze network traffic.

### Rules
- Do not attack the container's host system.
- Share your findings and solutions responsibly.

Good luck, and have fun hacking!
