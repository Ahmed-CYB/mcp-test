# Encrypted Partition Data
# Requires file_manager credentials
# Encryption: Simple XOR with key derived from password

# XOR Key: network (from decrypted file_manager password)
# Encrypted data (hex): 1a0a1c0b5f0d1c17455f11021c1a0b5f

# This contains the final flag fragment
# Use XOR decryption with key 'network' to reveal fragment 3
