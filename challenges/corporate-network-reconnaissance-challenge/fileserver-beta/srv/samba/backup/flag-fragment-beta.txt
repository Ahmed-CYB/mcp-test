TechCorp Security Assessment - Fragment Beta
===========================================

This file contains the second part of the network reconnaissance flag.

Fragment Beta: network_recon_

To complete the challenge, you must:
1. Discover and enumerate all services on the three target machines
2. Collect flag fragments from each system
3. Piece together the complete flag

Next steps:
- Continue scanning database-gamma (192.168.1.30)
- Look for database services and backup mechanisms
- Check for service-specific enumeration opportunities

Remember: Proper network reconnaissance requires systematic enumeration of all discovered services and careful analysis of accessible resources.

Fragment sequence: alpha + beta + gamma = complete flag
Current progress: CTF{corporate_ + network_recon_ + ???}
