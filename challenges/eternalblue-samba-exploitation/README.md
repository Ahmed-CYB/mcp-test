# eternalblue-samba-exploitation

## Description
A corporate file server is running a vulnerable version of Samba with SMB1 protocol enabled. Your mission is to exploit the EternalBlue-style vulnerability (CVE-2017-0144) to gain access to the system and retrieve sensitive corporate data. The server has SMB shares exposed with weak security configurations that can be exploited using known SMB vulnerabilities.

## Scenario
TechCorp's file server has been configured with legacy SMB settings to maintain compatibility with older systems. The administrator enabled SMBv1 protocol and configured several shares with weak access controls. Intelligence suggests that sensitive financial documents are stored on this server. Your task is to exploit the SMB service vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access and locate the hidden flag containing critical business intelligence.

## Difficulty
medium

## Machines
- **samba-fileserver** (victim): 172.24.193.45 - samba, ssh
- **attacker** (attacker): 172.24.193.3 - 

## Hints
1. Start with network reconnaissance to identify open SMB ports and available shares
2. Look for SMB shares that allow guest or anonymous access - some shares might be hidden from browsing
3. The server is configured with legacy SMB settings that allow null sessions and guest access to certain shares

## Flag Format
CTF{3t3rn4l_blu3_smb_pwn3d_2024}
