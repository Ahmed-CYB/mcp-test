# eternalblue-samba-exploitation

## Description
Exploit the EternalBlue vulnerability (MS17-010) in a misconfigured Samba server to gain unauthorized access and retrieve the flag. This challenge simulates the infamous NSA exploit that was leaked and used in the WannaCry ransomware attack.

## Scenario
You've discovered a Linux server running an outdated Samba service with SMBv1 enabled and vulnerable to the EternalBlue exploit (CVE-2017-0144). The server appears to have anonymous access enabled and contains sensitive data. Your mission is to exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the system and retrieve the classified flag file.

## Difficulty
medium

## Machines
- **samba-victim** (victim): 172.26.193.155 - samba, ssh
- **attacker-kali** (attacker): 172.26.193.3 - ssh

## Hints
1. Start by scanning the network to identify open SMB ports and services
2. Check if anonymous access is enabled on the SMB shares using smbclient
3. The Samba server might be vulnerable to MS17-010 (EternalBlue) - look for SMBv1 protocol support
4. Try using enum4linux or smbclient with null authentication to list available shares

## Flag Format
CTF{samba_anonymous_share_access_4_6_3}
