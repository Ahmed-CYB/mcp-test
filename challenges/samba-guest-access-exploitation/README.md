# samba-guest-access-exploitation

## Description
A corporate file server is running Samba with misconfigured guest access permissions. The server allows anonymous connections and contains sensitive data that should be restricted. Your task is to exploit the misconfiguration to gain unauthorized access to confidential files.

## Scenario
TechCorp's internal file server has been configured with Samba to share files across the network. A recent security audit revealed potential misconfigurations in the guest access settings. As a penetration tester, you need to identify and exploit these vulnerabilities to demonstrate the security risks. The server contains sensitive company data that should only be accessible to authenticated users.

## Difficulty
medium

## Machines
- **samba-server** (victim): 172.23.145.141 - samba, ssh
- **attacker** (attacker): 172.23.145.3 - 

## Hints
1. Start by scanning for SMB services and identifying open ports
2. Try enumerating SMB shares without authentication - guest access might be enabled
3. Look for shares that allow anonymous access and check their permissions
4. The confidential share might have more permissive settings than intended

## Flag Format
CTF{samba_guest_access_misconfiguration}
