# samba-guest-access-exploitation

## Description
A corporate file server is running Samba with a dangerous guest access misconfiguration. The administrator has enabled guest access to share sensitive files, creating a significant security vulnerability. Your task is to identify and exploit this misconfiguration to retrieve the hidden flag.

## Scenario
TechCorp recently deployed a new file server running Samba to share documents across departments. The system administrator, rushing to meet a deadline, enabled guest access for 'temporary convenience' but forgot to properly secure the shares. Intelligence suggests that sensitive company data, including security credentials, may be accessible through this misconfigured service. Your mission is to enumerate the Samba shares, identify the misconfiguration, and retrieve the confidential flag file.

## Difficulty
medium

## Machines
- **samba-server** (victim): 172.23.145.43 - samba, ssh
- **attacker** (attacker): 172.23.145.3 - 

## Hints
1. Start by scanning the target for open ports and identifying running services
2. Samba services often allow guest access - try enumerating shares without authentication
3. Look for shares that allow guest access and check their contents for sensitive files

## Flag Format
CTF{samba_guest_access_misconfiguration}
