# samba-guest-access-exploitation

## Description
A corporate file server is running Samba with guest access enabled. The system administrator has misconfigured the share permissions, allowing anonymous users to access sensitive directories. Your task is to enumerate the SMB shares, gain unauthorized access, and retrieve the confidential flag from the corporate file share.

## Scenario
TechCorp's IT department recently deployed a new file server running Samba to share documents across the organization. However, the junior administrator made a critical misconfiguration by enabling guest access and setting overly permissive share permissions. As a penetration tester, you've been hired to assess the security of their network infrastructure. Your goal is to identify and exploit the SMB misconfiguration to access sensitive corporate data.

## Difficulty
medium

## Machines
- **samba-server** (victim): 172.23.145.167 - samba, ssh
- **attacker** (attacker): 172.23.145.3 - ssh

## Hints
1. Start by scanning the target for open ports and services
2. SMB services often allow guest or anonymous access - try connecting without credentials
3. Use smbclient to enumerate and access shares: smbclient -L //target -N
4. Look for shares that allow guest access and browse their contents for sensitive files

## Flag Format
CTF{samba_guest_access_anonymous_share_pwned}
