# samba-guest-access-exploitation

## Description
A misconfigured Samba server allows guest access to sensitive shares. Your task is to identify the vulnerable SMB service, enumerate available shares, and retrieve the hidden flag from an accessible directory.

## Scenario
During a penetration test of a corporate network, you've discovered a Linux server running Samba file sharing services. The system administrator has misconfigured the server to allow guest access to certain shares. Your objective is to exploit this misconfiguration to access sensitive files and retrieve the flag.

## Difficulty
medium

## Machines
- **attacker** (attacker): 172.23.146.3 - ssh
- **samba-server** (victim): 172.23.146.93 - samba, ssh

## Hints
1. Start by scanning the network to identify open ports and services
2. SMB services typically run on ports 139 and 445. Try enumerating shares without authentication
3. Look for shares that allow guest or anonymous access - you might not need credentials

## Flag Format
CTF{...}
