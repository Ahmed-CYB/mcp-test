# samba-guest-access-exploitation

## Description
A corporate file server is running Samba with misconfigured guest access. Your task is to identify and exploit the vulnerability to retrieve sensitive information from the shared directories.

## Scenario
TechCorp's IT department has set up a Samba file server for internal document sharing. However, a recent security audit revealed that the server might be misconfigured, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive files. As a penetration tester, you need to assess the security of this file server and retrieve any confidential information that might be exposed.

## Difficulty
medium

## Machines
- **samba-server** (victim): 172.23.145.67 - samba, ssh
- **attacker** (attacker): 172.23.145.3 - ssh

## Hints
1. Start by scanning the network to identify open ports and services running on the target machine.
2. SMB services often allow guest access or anonymous connections - try connecting without credentials first.
3. Use SMB enumeration tools to list available shares and their permissions before attempting to access them.
