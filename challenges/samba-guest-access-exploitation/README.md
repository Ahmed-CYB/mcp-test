# samba-guest-access-exploitation

## Description
A corporate file server has been misconfigured to allow guest access to shared directories. Your task is to exploit this misconfiguration to access sensitive files and retrieve the flag. This challenge focuses on SMB/CIFS enumeration, guest session exploitation, and understanding Samba security misconfigurations.

## Scenario
TechCorp's IT department recently deployed a new file server running Samba to share documents across the organization. However, due to a configuration oversight, the server has been set up with guest access enabled and anonymous authentication allowed. As a penetration tester, you've discovered this server during your network reconnaissance. Your objective is to exploit the guest access vulnerability to access restricted directories and retrieve sensitive information.

## Difficulty
medium

## Machines
- **samba-fileserver** (victim): 172.23.145.80 - samba, ssh
- **attacker** (attacker): 172.23.145.3 - 

## Hints
1. Start with a port scan to identify running services on the target machine.
2. SMB services often allow guest access - try connecting without credentials first.
3. Not all shares may be visible in the initial enumeration - some might be hidden but still accessible.
4. Guest access might provide read permissions to directories that should be restricted.

## Flag Format
CTF{samba_guest_share_anonymous_access}
