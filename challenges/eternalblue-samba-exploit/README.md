# eternalblue-samba-exploit

## Description
A corporate file server is running an outdated Samba service vulnerable to the EternalBlue exploit (CVE-2017-0144). Your mission is to exploit this SMB vulnerability to gain access to the system and retrieve the confidential flag from the administrator's directory.

## Scenario
TechCorp's file server has been running the same Samba configuration for years without updates. Recent intelligence suggests they store sensitive documents on this server. The system administrator has been lazy with security patches, leaving the SMB service vulnerable to the infamous EternalBlue exploit. Use your penetration testing skills to exploit this vulnerability and extract the classified information.

## Difficulty
medium

## Machines
- **fileserver** (victim): 172.23.209.70 - samba, ssh
- **attacker** (attacker): 172.23.209.3 - 

## Hints
1. Start by scanning the target for open SMB ports and identifying the Samba version
2. Look for SMB shares that allow anonymous or guest access to gather information
3. The Samba service is configured with weak security settings that make it vulnerable to EternalBlue
4. Use Metasploit's ms17_010_eternalblue module or similar tools to exploit the vulnerability
5. Once you have a shell, explore the administrator's home directory for classified files

## Flag Format
CTF{3t3rn4l_blu3_smb_pwn3d_2024}
