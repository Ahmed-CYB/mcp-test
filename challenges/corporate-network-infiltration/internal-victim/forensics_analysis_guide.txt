FORENSICS ANALYSIS GUIDE - Corporate Network Infiltration
=========================================================

STEP 1: Analyze Network Reconnaissance
Review network_scan.txt to identify vulnerable services
Focus on FTP server (192.168.1.100) and internal victim (192.168.1.50)

STEP 2: Examine FTP Server Compromise
Analyze ftp_access.log for unauthorized access patterns
Identify downloaded files: credentials.txt, id_rsa_backup, encryption_key.b64

STEP 3: Recover FTP Server Artifacts
Extract credentials.txt for internal system access details
Recover SSH private key (id_rsa_backup) for lateral movement
Obtain encryption key (encryption_key.b64) for flag decryption

STEP 4: Trace Internal System Access
Review system_access.log for SSH login using recovered credentials
Identify privilege escalation and file access patterns

STEP 5: Decrypt the Flag
Base64 decode the encryption key: echo 'Q1RGe2Z0cF9zZXJ2ZXJfZXhwb3NlZF9jcmVkZW50aWFsc19hbmRfa2V5c30K' | base64 -d
This reveals the flag directly in the decoded content

STEP 6: Validate Analysis
Cross-reference memory analysis findings with log evidence
Confirm attack timeline and lateral movement path
