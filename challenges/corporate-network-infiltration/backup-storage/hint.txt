Corporate Infiltration Cryptography Challenge

Objective: Decrypt the secure vault to retrieve the flag

Hints:
1. FTP configuration contains SMB credentials using classical cipher
2. Atbash cipher: A↔Z, B↔Y, C↔X... (reverse alphabet substitution)
3. SMB vault has two key components - both needed for decryption
4. Primary key is heavily encoded - multiple layers to unwrap
5. Secondary key is Base64 encoded once
6. Final decryption uses AES-256-CBC with PBKDF2
7. OpenSSL can handle the final decryption step
8. The encrypted data is Base64 encoded

Challenge Flow:
FTP Config → Atbash Decode → SMB Access → Decode Keys → Decrypt Flag

Tools you might need:
- Text editor for Atbash decoding
- base64 command or online decoder
- openssl for AES decryption
