# Web Quiz SQL Injection Challenge

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the basics of SQL Injection
- Exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities
- Learn the importance of input validation and prepared statements

## Scenario
Welcome to the Corporate Quiz Portal, a simple web app where employees can log in to take company quizzes. However, due to a critical oversight, the login form is vulnerable to SQL Injection. Your goal is to exploit this vulnerability to retrieve the hidden flag meant for admin users.

## Setup
- Deploy the environment using Docker Compose.
- Access the victim application at http://victim:8080 from the Kali Linux desktop in the attacker container.

## Solution
The SQL Injection vulnerability is in the login form. By carefully crafting an input, bypass the login and access the admin flag.

## Hints
1. Think about how SQL Injection works in login forms.
2. A common trick is to use `' OR '1'='1` to bypass authentication.
3. Exploit the SQL query logic to gain admin access.
