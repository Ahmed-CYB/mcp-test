DataCorp Security Advisory
==========================

The company vault uses a two-step security approach:

1. Rail Fence Cipher Implementation
   - Pattern follows network infrastructure
   - Check topology documentation for rail count
   - Traditional zigzag pattern encryption

2. Base64 Encoding Layer
   - Standard RFC 4648 implementation
   - Applied after rail fence encryption
   - Decode first, then decrypt

Decryption Process:
- Extract encoded key from vault file
- Apply base64 decoding
- Use rail fence decryption with correct rail count
- Result should be a readable decryption key

Note: The final flag is hidden within the archived documents
once properly decrypted with the recovered key.
