# Anonymous FTP Challenge

## Overview
This CTF challenge involves exploiting a misconfigured FTP server that allows anonymous access. Participants must connect to the server and navigate the directory to find the flag.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand basic FTP commands
- Recognize the risks of anonymous FTP configurations
- Learn how to securely configure an FTP service

## Instructions
1. Access the Kali Linux attacker container through your web browser.
2. Use an FTP client to connect to the FTP server at `ftp://172.25.0.10`.
3. Log in using the username `anonymous` and any password.
4. Navigate the directory to locate and read the `flag.txt` file.

## Additional Information
- The FTP server is intentionally configured to allow anonymous access.
- Be mindful of network isolation rules and connect using the provided private IP.

## Hints
1. Use the `ftp` command-line tool to connect to the server.
2. Look for text files in the FTP root directory.
3. Access the file with the command `get flag.txt` once inside the directory.
