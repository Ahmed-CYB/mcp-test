# samba-anonymous-share-exploitation

## Description
A corporate file server is running Samba with misconfigured anonymous access. Your mission is to identify and exploit the anonymous share to retrieve sensitive company data.

## Scenario
SecureCorp recently deployed a new file server running Samba for internal document sharing. However, the system administrator made a critical configuration error that allows anonymous access to sensitive directories. As a penetration tester, you need to discover this misconfiguration and access the confidential files stored on the server.

## Difficulty
medium

## Machines
- **samba-server** (victim): 172.23.145.164 - samba, ssh
- **attacker-kali** (attacker): 172.23.145.3 - ssh

## Hints
1. Start by scanning the network to identify available services and open ports
2. SMB services often have shares that can be enumerated without authentication
3. Look for shares that allow guest or anonymous access - they might contain sensitive information
4. Use smbclient with null authentication to explore accessible shares and download files

## Flag Format
CTF{samba_anonymous_guest_share_access}
