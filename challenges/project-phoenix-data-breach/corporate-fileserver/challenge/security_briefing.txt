TECHCORP SECURITY BRIEFING - PROJECT PHOENIX

=== SECURE COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS ===

For all Project Phoenix communications, we will use a two-stage encryption process:

1. BINARY ENCODING: All messages must first be converted to binary format
2. RAIL FENCE CIPHER: Apply rail fence transposition with specified number of rails

REMEMBER: The rail fence cipher writes text in a zigzag pattern across multiple "rails" (lines), then reads off each rail sequentially.

Example with 3 rails:
Text: HELLO
Rail 1: H   O
Rail 2:  E L
Rail 3:   L
Result: HOELL

For decryption, reverse the process - arrange the ciphertext back into the rail pattern.

=== SECURITY NOTES ===
- Binary sequences should be converted to ASCII first
- Rail count varies by message - check transmission headers
- Always verify flag format: CTF{...}
