# Weak Vigenère Cipher Challenge

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how the Vigenère cipher works
- Learn about the weaknesses of using short keys
- Practice cryptanalysis techniques

## Challenge Description
Participants are given a message that has been encrypted using the Vigenère cipher with a short, predictable key. The task is to decrypt the message in order to retrieve the hidden flag. The challenge emphasizes the importance of using strong keys even in classical ciphers.

## Instructions
1. Access the Kali Linux attacker machine via the browser.
2. Navigate to the victim service running at `http://victim:8080`.
3. Analyze the encrypted message provided on the web page.
4. Use cryptanalysis techniques to decrypt the message and obtain the flag.

## Hint
- Remember that the Vigenère cipher is a repeating cipher, which means short keys can be easier to exploit.
